# Formula-Founder

You could install specific version formula in brew.

Simultaneously, you could select specific tap.

Don't use the [git checkout hash] to find previous version formula in homebrew-core.

Perhaps, it will make some errors.

```Shell

sh install_specific_version_formula.sh [formula name] [version] [specific tap, defaut is homebrew/cask]'

```
